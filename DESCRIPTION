Description: This package simulates regulations of ceRNAs' expressions after the change which occured in interacted miRNA and target RNAs. The package also presents a workflow or methodlogy for miRNA:target interactions and target regulation.     
    The package associates miRNA and ceRNA interactions with the regulation parameters optionally as well as expression levels of miRNA and target RNAs.The functions handle the given dataset as graph object and the processes progress via edge and node variables.
